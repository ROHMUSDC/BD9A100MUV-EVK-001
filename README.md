* Hardware Design Files and Documentation for the ROHM BD9A100MUV-EVK-001 EVK

----
### Description: 
* BD9A100MUV is a synchronous buck switching regulator with built-in low on-resistance power MOSFETs. 
* It is capable of providing current up to 1A.
* The SLLMTM control provides excellent efficiency characteristics in light-load conditions which make the product ideal for equipment and devices that demand minimal standby power consumption. 
* The oscillating frequency is high at 1MHz using a small value of inductance. 
* It is a current mode control DC/DC converter and features high-speed transient response. 
* Phase compensation can also be set easily.
